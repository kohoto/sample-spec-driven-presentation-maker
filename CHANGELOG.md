# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
(while in 0.x, breaking changes may occur in MINOR releases).

Entries before v0.5.0 were written retroactively as summaries.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`sdpm-composer` skill entry point** — a fourth thin dispatcher
  (`skills/sdpm-composer`) for the role a spawned composer sub-agent plays;
  it calls `read_workflows(["composer"])` and stops. Dedicated composer
  agent definitions (Kiro, Claude Code) now point at this skill instead of
  a `personas/composer.md` file reference.
- **`docs/en/migration-role-workflows.md`** — breaking-change table and per-environment
  migration steps for the workflow consolidation below.

### Changed

- **Compose is two passes: layout, then content** — the scaffold pass becomes the
  **layout pass** (`task_instruction: "Layout pass."`): one composer sees every slide and
  decides each slide's template layout, frame elements and named content regions
  (`_comment` elements with x/y/w/h, invisible in output), derived from one grid, written
  in one batched `run_python` call. Content composers realize their slides inside those
  regions. The consistency-review and fixes passes are gone: layout consistency is now
  by construction, and the orchestrator looks at previews and re-dispatches a composer
  per slide that needs a change.
- **`run_python` requires `deck_id`** — the sandbox always runs inside a deck
  workspace. The workspace-less "calculation" mode is gone: on the cloud it accepted
  file writes and discarded them silently (a composer lost a whole scaffold pass this
  way), on the local server it could not write at all. Create the deck with
  `init_presentation` first, then compute. Also new: `check_specs` validates
  deck.json and outline.md before composing (`compose_slides` runs it first).
- **Web UI Spec / Vibe and "Parallel agents" keep their behaviour without personas** —
  the orchestrator workflow defines two tokens, `Interaction mode: dialogue` (the user
  wants to shape the deck in conversation) and `Interaction mode: fast` (build from material);
  the cloud agent passes the token as a one-line system part and the local ACP route
  prepends it to a session's first prompt. `single` (parallel agents off) is the same
  workflow with no composer sub-agents, composing slides itself.
- **Outline sub-items are now `body` / `visual` / `evidence`** — these three keys replace
  `what_to_say` / `what_to_show` / `evidence` / `notes`. This is breaking for existing
  enriched outlines: old-key lines are shown as prose rather than parsed as slide sub-items.
- **Mode behavior consolidated into role documents, served via
  `read_workflows`** — `start_presentation(mode=...)` and `personas/*.md`
  are removed. Each role (orchestrator, composer, style, translate) now has
  exactly one document, `sdpm/references/workflows/<role>.md`, containing
  both the role definition and its procedure; entry points (skills, agent
  definitions, `SKILL.md`, server instructions) only ever name a role for
  `read_workflows` to fetch, never restate its behavior. This removes the
  persona/workflow duplication that v0.5's persona layer had reintroduced.
- **`vibe` and `spec` modes merged into a single `sdpm-create` skill** —
  the dialogue-depth distinction is gone; how much back-and-forth happens
  is driven by the user's own wording, not a mode argument. `skills/sdpm-vibe`
  and `skills/sdpm-spec` are replaced by `skills/sdpm-create`.
  `skills/sdpm-style` and `skills/sdpm-translate` are unchanged in purpose,
  now dispatching to `read_workflows(["style"])` / `read_workflows(["translate"])`.
- **CLI subcommands renamed to match MCP tool (contract) names** — e.g.
  `generate` → `generate_pptx`, `examples` → `read_examples`,
  `workflows` → `read_workflows`, `guides` → `read_guides`,
  `analyze-template` → `analyze_template`, `search-assets` → `search_assets`,
  `list-templates` → `list_templates`, `init` → `init_presentation`,
  `code-block` → `code_to_slide`, `layout` → `arch_diagram`,
  `diff` → `diff_pptx`. Workflow/guide text now reads identically whether
  called as an MCP tool or a CLI subcommand. No aliases for the old names.
  See [Migration: role workflows](docs/en/migration-role-workflows.md) for the full table.
- **`slide-json-spec` moved to `sdpm/references/spec/`** — it is a fact
  document, not a role document; still resolved by `read_workflows` for
  backward compatibility. **`hand-edit-sync` moved to
  `sdpm/references/guides/`** — it is an occasional-need procedure, not a
  role.

### Removed

- **`sdpm/references/examples/patterns.pptx` and the `search-patterns`
  CLI/tool** — an audit of all 18 cataloged patterns found their techniques
  either duplicated in `components/all` or not measurably improving output
  versus letting the model reason from the style HTML and component
  vocabulary directly. No migration path; if a specific technique is
  needed again, express it directly in slide JSON per
  `read_workflows(["slide-json-spec"])`.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- **WebP previews and deck thumbnails were not generated after v0.8.1.**
  `schedule_webp_background` relied on an asyncio event loop; tools now run on
  worker threads, so the task silently never started and `generate_pptx`
  produced no slide previews and no thumbnail. It runs on a daemon thread now.
- **`get_preview` right after `run_python` could see a missing or stale image.**
  v0.8.1 moved preview generation into a background task; `get_preview` now
  waits for that task (per deck, up to 90s), and the task renders the
  measured slugs' WebP before the live-preview JSON.
- **Code Interpreter session start could stall for minutes on AgentCore V2.**
  Every AWS client now uses a 5s connect timeout. Prompt APIs (S3, DynamoDB,
  SSM, session start/stop, embeddings) get read 30s / 3 attempts; the user-code
  `invoke_code_interpreter` gets read 600s and a single attempt so a stall can
  never execute the code twice.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- **Remote MCP server no longer stalls or dies during long tool calls.**
  FastMCP ran synchronous tools on the event loop, so a minute in
  LibreOffice blocked AgentCore's `/ping` and the session was terminated
  mid-run. Every remote tool now runs in a worker thread (`offloaded_tool`);
  the WebP background task does too.
- **AgentCore Runtime platform V2: first S3 call after restore no longer
  hangs.** boto3 clients built at import carried connection state into the
  V2 snapshot; the first call on a restored microVM could block for minutes
  (observed: `list_templates` unanswered after 9 min). Clients are now built
  on first use, with bounded botocore timeouts (connect 5s / read 30s /
  3 attempts / TCP keepalive).
- **AgentCore Runtime platform V2: LibreOffice's first run per microVM
  (~60s) is warmed in the background.** The restored root filesystem is
  lazily fetched, so the first `soffice` run paid ~60s of first-touch disk
  reads (3s thereafter). The server now converts a blank template in the
  background when an MCP session starts, before the composer reaches its
  first `run_python`. Measured: layout-pass `run_python` 85s → 14s.

### Changed

- **`run_python` returns as soon as measure is done.** The live-preview
  JSON (compose) and the measured slugs' WebP finish in a background thread;
  `previewHint` now says the images are being generated. Previews render
  only the measured pages, the LibreOffice SVG is parsed once, and per-slug
  compose runs in a thread pool. Phase timings (`prepare_s3`, `build`,
  `measure`, `artifact_s3`, background compose) are logged at INFO.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-09-20

### Added

- **Scaffold pass in the compose workflow** — before the parallel content
  composers fan out, the orchestrator now dispatches one composer with
  `task_instruction: "Scaffold pass."` (a new composer mode alongside
  `"Consistency review."`). It batch-writes the style- and role-derived
  elements every slide shares — decoration from the art direction (accent
  bars, footer, title band) and role elements with per-slide parameters
  (titles/subtitles drafted from the outline, section labels) — into every
  `slides/*.json` via a single programmatic `run_python` for-loop (no
  individual slide edits in this mode). Elements that require imagining a
  slide's content stay with the content composers. Page numbers are
  explicitly forbidden as elements — they come from the template's native
  slide-number placeholder. Content composers then read the existing JSON
  and build on the frame instead of rewriting whole files. Cross-slide
  decoration consistency moves from post-hoc review fixes to
  by-construction, and near-identical JSON is no longer re-emitted per
  slide (token savings). Persona-only change (`personas/composer.md`,
  `vibe.md`, `spec.md`).
- **Per-user usage measurement** (#326) — Bedrock usage logs (`bedrock_usage`)
  now carry `user_id` / `session_id` / `deck_id` (composer invocations
  included), and new structured events count slides per user:
  `slides_composed` (per compose_slides call) and `slides_built` (per
  successful PPTX build). A new opt-in flag `features.enableTransactionSearch`
  (or `deploy.sh --enable-transaction-search`) enables CloudWatch Transaction
  Search for span-level per-user token queries and the GenAI Observability
  dashboard. See [Measuring Usage](docs/en/usage-measurement.md).
- **`sendToBack` element key — z-order control over placeholders** — elements
  normally render in front of template placeholders (the builder fills
  placeholders first), so a full-bleed decorative image always covered the
  title with no recourse. `"sendToBack": true` moves an element behind the
  placeholders; multiple marked elements keep their relative order. The
  PPTX importer now emits it automatically for shapes that preceded the
  first used placeholder in the source slide, so imported decks keep their
  original stacking. (#316)
- **`pptx_builder.py preview -o/--output-dir`** — the CLI preview can now
  write PNGs to a chosen directory (e.g. `{deck_dir}/preview`) instead of
  always using a temporary `_work/` folder; `--no-grid` already existed.
  `sdpm.api.preview` gains the matching `output_dir` parameter. (#316)
- **`repr` and `__name__` in the `run_python` sandbox** — agent code using
  `repr()` or the `__main__` idiom no longer needs rewriting. (#316)
- **`translate` mode with a `/sdpm-translate` entry point** — deck translation
  is now a first-class mode: `start_presentation(mode="translate")` serves
  `personas/translate.md`, and a fourth thin skill entry point
  (`skills/sdpm-translate`) exposes it as a slash command in every client
  that maps skills, alongside vibe/spec/style. The persona drives the
  existing `translate-pptx` workflow (extract → dictionary → apply → build)
  and makes the agent itself fill the translation dictionary.

- **`make install-kiro` generates a dedicated composer agent again** —
  `<KIRO_HOME>/agents/sdpm-composer.json` gives parallel compose workers the
  sdpm MCP server only, with pre-approved tools and a generous startup
  timeout. Without it, workers fall back to a general-purpose agent that
  cold-starts every MCP server in the profile per worker; on MCP-heavy
  profiles this made some parallel composers miss the sdpm server
  nondeterministically (observed with 30+ registered servers). The generated
  config is a thin pointer — its prompt is a `file://` reference into
  `personas/composer.md`, never inline behavior — and it is lifecycle-managed
  by the same ownership audit as the rest of the wiring (own/stale are
  regenerated, foreign/unknown are never touched; power mode still removes
  it). v0.5.3 dropped generation because the old installer could not manage
  the file safely across checkouts; the ownership audit removed that reason.

- **Mode entry points are back, as thin dispatchers** — `skills/sdpm-vibe`,
  `skills/sdpm-spec` and `skills/sdpm-style` let users pick a mode explicitly
  (`/sdpm-vibe` and friends in clients that expose skills as slash commands).
  v0.5.0 removed `skills/` because each file had grown a full copy of the mode
  behavior that then drifted; these are ~20 lines each and contain no behavior
  text. They call `start_presentation(mode=...)` and stop, so `personas/*.md`
  remains the only definition. A test fails if any substantial persona line
  reappears in an entry point.
- **The repository root is an Agent Plugins 1.0.0 package** — `plugin.json` and
  `mcp.json` make it loadable by Kiro (as a Power), Cursor, GitHub Copilot and
  VS Code without a client-specific installer. `mcp.json` points `uv` at
  `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/servers/local` and puts the virtualenv under
  `${PLUGIN_DATA}`, because clients copy the plugin into an install cache that
  may be read-only and is replaced on update.
- **Codex support** — `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, a bundled MCP server
  definition in `.mcp.json`, and a repo marketplace at
  `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, so `codex plugin marketplace add ./` is
  enough to install the checkout locally. Codex was previously limited to the
  Layer 1 CLI path.
- **Claude Code exposes the same entry points** — `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
  gained `skills` (bumped to 0.3.0). Its `agents` and `mcpServers` blocks are
  unchanged.
- `clients/kiro/install.py` gained `--mode {auto,legacy,power}`, `--kiro-home`
  and `--replace-existing`.
- **GPT-6 Astra** (`global.openai.gpt-6-astra`) is selectable for chat and
  create. Throughput is roughly a third of GPT-5.6 Terra (~25 vs ~90 output
  tokens/s measured in `ap-northeast-1`), so expect longer waits on
  compose-heavy runs.
- **Kimi K3** (`global.moonshotai.kimi-k3`) is selectable for chat and create.
  Its Converse constraints are identical to the GPT models' — it rejects
  `temperature`, `topP` and Bedrock's `cachePoint`, while its own implicit
  prompt caching is on by default — so it reuses the same invocation profile
  and needed no new agent code. Throughput is competitive with GPT-5.6 Terra
  (~80–175 output tokens/s measured in `ap-northeast-1`). Note it always emits
  reasoning content, and those tokens count against the output budget: a
  one-word answer costs ~50 output tokens where Claude spends ~5, so short
  interactions are disproportionately expensive.

### Changed

- **MCP servers connect concurrently instead of one after another** — Strands
  connects them serially: `ToolRegistry.process_tools()` iterates the tools list
  and blocks on `await provider.load_tools()` for each ToolProvider in turn. With
  three servers — the Presentation Maker one on AgentCore plus two AWS servers
  pinned to `us-east-1` — that put their handshakes on the critical path back to
  back, and a profile attributed roughly 2.6s to the two AWS ones alone. They are
  now connected up front in a thread pool; `load_tools()` caches its result, so
  Strands' own call is a cache hit. Measured on the dev stack: agent setup went
  from 7.72s to **5.14s**. As a side effect the `required` flag in `MCP_DEFS` now
  does what it always claimed — it was only guarding client construction, which is
  lazy and cannot fail, so an unreachable optional server used to surface as a hard
  failure inside Strands (`MCPClient` defaults to `continue_on_error=False`).
  An optional server that cannot be reached is now dropped with a status entry.
- **`diff_pptx` is no longer offered on the cloud path** — `servers/remote` does not
  bind it, so listing it in the agent's tool allowlist produced a "not found on MCP
  server" warning on every request. The hand-edit sync workflow stays a local/CLI
  capability and the workflow document says so; the tool is slated for removal.

- **OpenAI GPT models are served through the Converse API** instead of
  `bedrock-mantle`. They are now registered under their global inference
  profile ids (`global.openai.gpt-5.6-terra`, `global.openai.gpt-6-astra`) and
  go through the same `BedrockModel` path as every other model. This removes
  `agent/mantle_client.py`, the `MANTLE_MODELS` / `MANTLE_RESPONSES_MODELS`
  tables and their region-resolution helper, the OpenAI SDK dependency
  (`strands-agents[openai]`), and the `bedrock-mantle:CreateInference` /
  `bedrock-mantle:CallWithBearerToken` IAM grants on the agent role.
  Prompt caching still applies: these models do not accept Bedrock's
  `cachePoint` block, but their own implicit prompt caching is on by default.

### Removed

- **GPT-5.5 and GPT-5.4** — not available as Bedrock foundation models, so they
  cannot be reached over the Converse API. They were only ever callable through
  the removed `bedrock-mantle` path.
- **Nova 2 Lite** — it was registered as `us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0`, a
  US-only cross-region inference profile that does not exist in the deployment
  region, so selecting it always failed with `ValidationException: The provided
  model identifier is invalid`.

### Fixed

- **The Claude Code plugin manifest tracks the engine version again** —
  `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` sat at `0.3.0` while the engine reached `0.7.1`.
  `plugin.json` and `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` each had a test asserting they
  follow `sdpm.__version__`; this manifest had none, so the drift went unnoticed
  across several releases. It now carries the same guard.


- **The knowledge base id is resolved per request instead of at import** — the
  remote MCP server read `KB_SSM_PARAM` from SSM at module import and built its
  `KBSync` from the result. SSM exists so that value can change without a
  redeploy, so caching it at startup pinned the runtime to whatever the id was
  when the process began. It is now resolved on first use and refreshed every
  300s. This also matters on AgentCore Runtime `platformVersion` V2, which
  snapshots the process after initialization and shares that memory state with
  every restored instance: a value read at import is frozen for the life of the
  snapshot, where V1's periodic container recycling used to re-read it. Tool
  registration for `search_slides` now depends on configuration rather than on a
  successful read, so a transient SSM failure no longer removes the tool for the
  life of the process.
- **MCP requests no longer start a new microVM on every agent turn** — the agent
  connected to the Presentation Maker MCP server on AgentCore Runtime without
  sending `Mcp-Session-Id`. AgentCore routes MCP requests to a microVM by that
  header and mints a fresh session id for any request arriving without one, so
  each agent turn — plus each composer slide group, which builds its own client —
  paid a new-session start on a 630 MiB image. The caller's session id is now
  forwarded, and composer groups use `{session_id}-g{n}` so they keep the
  per-group isolation they were written for while still reusing their own microVM
  across composes. Measured in `ap-northeast-1`: 0.18-0.20s with a consistent id,
  0.59s without one when warm capacity happened to be available, and 17.6-19.7s
  without one when it was not. Replaying an id after the 900s idle timeout returns
  HTTP 200 and re-establishes the session, so no re-initialize path is needed
  (verified for the stateless MCP server this project runs).
- **Importing an attachment from a URL works again** — `fetch_url` sends
  `Connection: close`, which makes `http.client` set `response.will_close`, and
  `getresponse()` then hands the connection to the response by calling
  `HTTPConnection.close()` — setting `conn.sock` to `None` before a single byte of
  the body is read. The body loop re-armed its idle read timeout on that socket
  every iteration, so every URL fetch died with `AttributeError: 'NoneType'
  object has no attribute 'settimeout'` and the agent reported the failure as a
  sandbox networking problem. The loop now re-arms the timeout on a socket
  reference captured before `getresponse()`, and stops once the body is closed
  (the fd is really gone by then). The idle read timeout is preserved rather than
  dropped: it is still bounded by both `IDLE_READ_TIMEOUT_S` and the remaining
  total budget on every read.
- **Tool results carrying images work on GPT models** — OpenAI GPT models on
  Bedrock Converse reject an `image` block nested inside a `toolResult`
  (`ValidationException: This model doesn't support the image field for user
  messages`), which broke slide-preview review in compose and `web_fetch` on
  image URLs. A `BeforeModelCallEvent` hook (`agent/message_hooks.py`) now
  moves such images up to sit beside the `toolResult` in the same user message
  — a shape both GPT and Claude accept, so it is applied to every model rather
  than gated per model. The image still reaches the model, so vision is
  preserved. It runs before every model call (not on message-added), so it also
  normalizes pre-seeded composer history and restored sessions.
- **GPT models no longer send `temperature`** — both GPT-6 Astra and GPT-5.6
  Terra reject the field on Converse (`This model doesn't support the
  temperature field`). The removed `bedrock-mantle` path had accepted it, so
  the profile carried `temperature=0.7` until the migration.

- **Bedrock invocation-logging custom resource is now idempotent** — it
  previously overwrote an existing account-level logging configuration on
  deploy; it now checks first and skips if logging is already configured to a
  different destination (matching the documented "skipped if already
  configured" behavior). (#326)
- **The deck-translation workflow is reachable again** — `translate-pptx`
  existed as a workflow document but nothing routed to it: the MCP server
  instructions menu stopped at D and no persona mentioned it, so an agent
  asked to translate a deck could only find it by spontaneously calling
  `list_workflows`. It is now Workflow E in the server instructions
  (pointing at the new translate mode), with routing lines in the vibe and
  single personas. The translate scripts also
  moved from the repo-root `scripts/` (deploy helpers, not shipped with the
  skill) to `sdpm/scripts/` next to `pptx_builder.py`, so the workflow's
  `scripts/translate_extract.py` commands resolve relative to the skill root
  like every other workflow — and Layer 1 skill installs actually get them.

- **`make install-kiro` no longer hijacks another checkout's Kiro setup** —
  the MCP registration was re-registered with `--force` whenever the existing
  `sdpm` entry pointed elsewhere, and the composer-agent cleanup deliberately
  deleted configs generated for any checkout. Running the installer from a
  second clone therefore repointed a working install. Every artifact the
  installer can write (MCP registration, skill symlinks, legacy composer agent)
  is now classified as own / stale / foreign / unknown against the current
  checkout; only own, stale and absent are written, foreign requires
  `--replace-existing`, and unknown is never touched. Conflicts exit non-zero
  with a report instead of succeeding quietly.
  Behavior change: a leftover pointing at a checkout that still exists is now
  left alone. One pointing at a *moved* checkout is still repaired, which was
  the staleness that cleanup existed for.
- **`clients/kiro/install.py` honours `KIRO_HOME`** — it hardcoded `~/.kiro`,
  so installs into a non-default Kiro profile silently wrote to the wrong one.
  `KIRO_HOME` is now also exported to the `kiro-cli` child process, since
  `mcp add --scope global` resolves "global" itself. Powers are global-scope
  only, so a separate profile is the only way to keep a Kiro CLI install and a
  Power install from colliding.

- **Importer: white text baked onto light cards (white-on-white)** — the
  converter adopted the shape style's `fontRef` color even when the shape's
  own `lstStyle` carried an explicit text color, which outranks `fontRef`
  in OOXML. Decks whose light-fill cards define dark text via `lstStyle`
  came back with `fontColor: #FFFFFF`. (#316)
- **Importer/builder: arrowheads lost their size** — `tailEnd`/`headEnd`
  `w`/`len` attributes are now round-tripped (`arrowEndWidth`,
  `arrowEndLength`, `arrowStartWidth`, `arrowStartLength`), so a large
  arrowhead no longer comes back as the small default.
- **Importer/builder: gradient direction distorted on non-square shapes** —
  the `scaled` attribute of linear gradients was dropped on import and
  forced to `1` on build. A `scaled="0"` gradient (true geometric angle) on
  a wide bar now renders at its original angle.
- **Importer/builder: partially-rounded rectangles on pictures** — image
  masks were limited to a 9-name allowlist and dropped their adjustment
  values. Any OOXML preset now passes through (`round1Rect`,
  `round2SameRect`, …) with its `avLst` preserved, so e.g. a picture panel
  with one rounded corner survives the round trip.
- **measure: white-on-white false positives over gradient shapes** — the
  contrast judge only recognized gradients written as `style="fill:url(…)"`;
  LibreOffice sometimes emits `fill="url(…)"` as an attribute, making the
  background "unknown" and falling back to the white slide background. Both
  forms are now treated as unknowable background (contrast check skipped).
  (#316)
- **lint: `shape-unknown-name` noise on imported decks** — camelCase raw
  OOXML presets (which the builder renders verbatim) are no longer flagged;
  pure-lowercase typos still are. (#316)

## [0.7.1] - 2026-08-05

### Fixed

- **Nested styled-text notation no longer leaks raw tags onto slides** —
  agents sometimes emit `{{bold:{{#FF0000:X}}}}` instead of the canonical
  `{{bold,#FF0000:X}}`; the parser could not see through nesting and rendered
  the inner tag as literal text. A flatten pre-pass now normalizes nesting
  (any depth, partial nesting included) to the comma form, with inner
  attributes taking priority. Non-nested input is untouched. (#123)
- **Builtin template download works from the Web UI** — downloading blank-dark /
  blank-light did nothing: the download used a `fetch()`+blob path that requires
  CORS, and the builtin resource bucket has no CORS configuration (user templates
  live in a different bucket that has one). Downloads now use the same direct-link
  navigation as deck PPTX downloads (no CORS involved), the presigned URL carries
  `Content-Disposition: attachment`, and failures show an error toast instead of
  silently doing nothing. (#281)
- **`grid` tool returns actionable errors and supports `%` / `repeat()`** —
  unsupported CSS track syntax (`auto`, `minmax()`, previously also `%` and
  `repeat()`) crashed with an uncaught `ValueError` instead of an error message
  the agent can react to. `%` and `repeat(n, X)` are now supported, unsupported
  syntax returns `{"error": ...}` naming the offending token, and the supported
  subset is documented in the tool docstring and grid guide. (#282)
- **Live preview: icons relying on even-odd fill no longer render as solid
  boxes** — LibreOffice's SVG export declares `fill-rule="evenodd"` only on the
  root `<svg>`, which the per-component fragment split dropped, so multi-subpath
  line-art icons (many AWS resource icons) lost their cutouts and appeared as
  filled rectangles in the live preview (final PNGs were unaffected). Root
  inheritable attributes are now propagated onto each fragment. (#288)

- **Architecture diagram box auto-height now works on non-16:9 templates and
  with CJK text** — the engine used a fixed 16:9 pt-to-px ratio for text
  measurement, causing boxes to undersize on 4:3 and other aspect ratios, and
  did not account for fullwidth (CJK) character width. `analyze_template` now
  reports `ptPerPx` in `slide_size`, the agent records it in `deck.json`
  `slideSize`, and `arch_diagram` accepts a `pt_per_px` parameter for accurate
  calibration. (#285)
- **Remote MCP: `analyze_template` now includes `slide_size` in cached
  results** — the cached template analysis omitted the `slide_size` field, so
  subsequent calls returned an incomplete response and the agent could not
  populate `deck.json` `slideSize`. (#285)

- **Custom templates with non-16:9 slide sizes (4:3 etc.) now lay out correctly** —
  the engine's px coordinate system followed the template width but assumed a
  fixed height of 1080, so 4:3 decks left the bottom quarter of every slide
  empty, reported false out-of-bounds warnings, mismatched placeholder
  coordinates, mis-measured text overflow, and rendered cropped previews in the
  Web UI. The canvas is now derived from the template's real dimensions
  (1920 px wide, height following the aspect ratio — 4:3 becomes 1920×1440),
  and `analyze_template` / `deck.json` carry the canvas size so slide
  composition uses the full slide. Behaviour for 16:9 templates is unchanged.
  Known limitation: architecture diagram boxes with an omitted `box.height`
  can still under-estimate text height on non-16:9 templates — specify
  `box.height` explicitly. (#208)
- **Live slide preview: the first few slides now animate** — animation was
  suppressed for 3 seconds after the slides tab appeared, and because a new
  deck switches to that tab as soon as slides arrive, the first slides were
  always shown instantly. Suppression is now based on whether the slides
  already existed when the view mounted, instead of a timer.
- **Live slide preview: the PNG fallback now actually appears** — the error
  state was reset on every 1-second poll, so the fallback was unmounted before
  it could be seen; a failure to find the render container also marked the
  slide as permanently processed, leaving an empty black box. Slides with
  nothing to draw now fall back to the rendered PNG, and the fallback image
  retries expired signed URLs.

- **AWS: uploaded custom templates now apply to PPTX generation** — the remote
  server's template resolution only searched builtin templates, so a deck
  referencing an uploaded user template silently fell back to
  `blank-dark.pptx`. Generation now resolves user templates first (same order
  as `analyze_template`), and an unresolvable template name raises an explicit
  error listing available templates instead of silently using the wrong
  design. (#206)

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- **Web UI: live design studio** — full visual redesign. Light/Dark/System
  themes (default dark), 90–125% text scaling, studio color tokens (5 agent
  work colors, ink for deliverables, red reserved for errors), and a
  two-voice typography system (Bricolage Grotesque for UI chrome, Fraunces
  for document surfaces).
- **Web UI: artifact-first review surfaces** — chat tool activity as a
  compact agent work ledger; brief as a reviewable contract document with
  approval state; outline as single-column narrative slides (number rail,
  slim skeleton cards, enriched slide faces with an evidence/visual/notes
  spec sheet); art direction as per-slide style cards sharing the same rail
  grammar, with template and style sections on one alignment axis.
- Outline workflow now asks for `##` section headings when a deck has
  distinct parts, so review surfaces can render the story arc as chapters.

### Changed

- Style cover extraction is unified client-side: both `/styles` APIs
  (cloud and local) now serve raw style HTML (`html` field replaces
  `coverHtml`), and the style gallery opens previews with zero additional
  round-trips.
- Style previews and thumbnails keep the style author's own canvas
  background instead of forcing transparency.

### Fixed

- Style thumbnails rendered the first slide at 70% (standalone-viewing
  `body zoom` was not reset in the cloud cover path), leaving gutters
  around the cover; slides now fill thumbnails edge-to-edge.
- Unpainted regions of style slides (rounded corners, frame decorations)
  showed as opaque white inside the dark UI.
- One deck slide always fits the viewport in the full-size carousel view.
- Prose art direction (`art-direction.md`, no style selected) rendered as
  raw markdown inside an iframe; it is now typeset as a document.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-02

### Breaking

- **Stateless attachment pipeline** — `upload_file`, `read_uploaded_file`, and
  public MCP `pptx_to_json` tools are removed. Use `read_attachment(source)`
  and `import_attachment(source, deck_id)` instead. The new tools are stateless
  (no session storage, no uploadId) and accept local paths, S3 keys, or URLs
  directly.
- **`measure_slides` standalone tool removed** — measurement is now triggered
  exclusively via `run_python(measure_slides=[...])`.
- **`list_asset_sources` tool removed** — call `search_assets(query="")` for
  the same discovery listing (sources with counts).
- **`run_python` / `run_style_python` `save` parameter removed** — writes
  always persist; the deprecated flag is no longer accepted.
- **`run_python` `files` parameter removed** — use `read_attachment` to access
  uploaded file content, then reference by path in code.
- **Session restart required** — after `git pull`, restart all Local Web UI /
  ACP sessions. The next spawn will pick up the updated agent definitions
  (`agents-sync.ts` re-derives from `acp-agents/`). `make install-kiro` is
  only needed for global MCP config cleanup, not for allowlist updates.

### Changed

- `search_assets` now supports discovery mode: calling with an empty query
  (`query=""`) returns all asset sources with counts, replacing the removed
  `list_asset_sources` tool.
- `diff_pptx` now accepts committed import bundle directories as input,
  enabling the hand-edit sync workflow without the public `pptx_to_json` tool.
- Cloud file attachments use `POST /attachments/presign` + direct S3 PUT;
  Local Web UI uses `POST /api/attachments`. The `[Attached:...]` marker
  format is now `[Attached:{"v":1,"name":"...","source":"..."}]`.

### Fixed

- Cloud and local ACP deck agents now expose `arch_diagram`, as required by the
  composition workflow, so architecture, system, and flow diagrams use automatic
  routing and crossing minimization instead of silently falling back to manual
  placement.
- Attachment presigned PUTs now use Signature Version 4 — S3 rejects the
  conditional write (`If-None-Match`) with legacy SigV2 URLs, which broke all
  browser uploads in some regions (e.g. ap-northeast-1).
- The Web UI no longer sends a message when an attachment upload fails: input
  and attachments are kept for retry and the actual error (e.g. quota
  exceeded) is shown instead of a generic failure.
- Per-user raw attachment caps recalibrated for internal/team deployments
  (1000 objects / 50GB, overridable via `ATTACHMENT_MAX_OBJECTS` /
  `ATTACHMENT_MAX_BYTES`), and S3 lifecycle rules are prefix-only so
  attachment objects from pre-0.6 releases (which carry no `sdpm-class` tag)
  also expire. Deployments upgrading from the old upload pipeline should
  purge leftover `uploads/` objects — they otherwise count toward the quota.
- `servers/remote/constraints.txt` regenerated via `make lock`;
  `cachetools` / `protobuf` are pinned by `aws-opentelemetry-distro` and are
  now excluded from Dependabot bumps until the distro itself is upgraded.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-08-01

### Changed

- **Kiro CLI: composer sub-agents are now self-spawned** — `make install-kiro`
  no longer generates `~/.kiro/agents/sdpm-composer.json`; the orchestrating
  agent spawns composer workers itself and pulls the composer behavior through
  `start_presentation(mode="composer")`. Upgrading from v0.5.2 or earlier,
  re-run `make install-kiro` once: it removes the legacy generated agent file
  (only if unmodified; a customized file is left in place with a warning).
- `start_presentation` now accepts `mode="single"` (one agent handles dialogue
  and composition end-to-end), making every persona reachable through the port.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-08-01

### Changed

- **`run_python` persistence semantics unified**: file writes now always
  persist — the `save` flag is deprecated and ignored (silent data loss when
  omitting `save=True` on Cloud is no longer possible). The deck's PPTX
  artifact refreshes automatically whenever the deck changes;
  `measure_slides` remains the trigger for the expensive verification pass
  (render, text overflow measurement, previews). Cloud sandbox write-back is
  now diff-based (changed/new files only), preventing a stale sandbox copy
  from overwriting newer S3 writes

### Fixed

- Cloud: superseded PPTX artifacts are now deleted after each refresh — the
  automatic artifact refresh no longer accumulates orphaned objects in S3
  (`update_deck` returns previous values via `UPDATED_OLD`)

## [0.5.1] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- `make doctor` — diagnoses local setup (uv / LibreOffice / poppler, checkout
  path anchors) with a moved-checkout hint
- `make smoke` — boots the local MCP server over real stdio and verifies
  template/persona resolution (also runs in CI)
- GitHub Releases are now created automatically on tag push (notes extracted
  from this changelog)

### Fixed

- **Cloud agent output-token limit**: model profiles now set an explicit
  `max_tokens` (Claude 32768, others 8192) — Bedrock's small default truncated
  long single-call outputs (e.g. writing `specs/brief.md` from a long article)
  and killed the turn with a generic error. `MaxTokensReachedException` is also
  classified now (`max_output`) so the Web UI shows an actionable message
  instead of "something went wrong".

### Changed

- **L4 agent personas unified**: the cloud agent (Strands) now fetches mode
  behavior from `personas/*.md` through the same `start_presentation(mode=...)`
  port as every other client, instead of carrying its own copies in
  `agent/prompts/role/`. Duplicated role/workflow prompt files were removed;
  only transport-specific wiring (attachment wire format, `compose_slides`
  report format) remains in `agent/prompts/`. Prompt changes now touch only
  `personas/` for all layers.
- **Internal API move**: `sdpm.engine.diff.diff_report` / `load_slides_json_or_pptx`
  moved to `sdpm.api` (dependency-rule fix; `engine.diff` now exposes the pure
  `diff_slides(base, edit)`). These were internal APIs — update imports if you
  consumed them directly.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-31

Breaking architecture cleanup. No changes to the slide JSON schema — existing
decks and cloud data keep working. See the
[migration guide](docs/en/migration-v0.5.md) for upgrade steps.

### Changed (breaking)

- **Directory layout**: `skill/` → `sdpm/`, `mcp-local/` → `servers/local/`,
  `mcp-server/` → `servers/remote/`, `agents/` → `clients/claude-code/agents/`
- **Engine split**: the `sdpm` package is now organised as two peer subpackages —
  `sdpm.engine` (json ↔ pptx) and `sdpm.knowledge` (references / assets)
- **Skill files removed**: mode behavior now lives in `personas/*.md` and is
  served to any MCP client via the new `start_presentation(mode=...)` tool.
  Claude Code plugin no longer installs skills; Kiro installer no longer
  symlinks skill directories
- **Single tool contract**: every MCP tool is defined once in `sdpm.tools`;
  both servers bind the same functions (local: 24 tools, remote: 22 tools)
- **Docs**: English docs are canonical; Japanese docs reduced to README and
  getting-started

### Added

- `start_presentation(mode=...)` MCP tool — serves vibe / spec / style /
  composer / single personas to any MCP client
- `SDPM_SKILL_ROOT` environment override for path anchors (used by the remote
  Docker image, gateway integrations)
- Migration guide: `docs/en/migration-v0.5.md`

### Fixed

- Pinned `mcp>=1.28.1,<2` across local server, remote server, and agent —
  mcp 2.0.0 removed `mcp.server.fastmcp` and crashed fresh container builds
